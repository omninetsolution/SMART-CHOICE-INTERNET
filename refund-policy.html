            <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
            <p class="legal-updated">Last Updated: February 11, 2026</p>

            <div class="legal-content">
                <h2>1. Overview</h2>
                <p>Smart Choice Internet is committed to customer satisfaction. This Refund Policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be issued for our independent technical assistance services.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Smart Choice Internet is an independent third-party service assistance provider. We are not affiliated with, authorized by, or endorsed by any internet, cable, or telecom service provider. This policy applies only to fees paid to Smart Choice Internet for our assistance services—not to charges from your internet or cable provider.</p>

                <h2>2. Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 Full Refund Situations</h3>
                <p>You may be eligible for a full refund if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Service Provided:</strong> We charged your payment method but did not provide any assistance</li>
                    <li><strong>Duplicate Charge:</strong> You were accidentally charged twice for the same service</li>
                    <li><strong>Unauthorized Charge:</strong> A charge was made without your authorization</li>
                    <li><strong>Fee Misrepresentation:</strong> The amount charged differs significantly from what was disclosed to you</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Partial Refund Situations</h3>
                <p>You may be eligible for a partial refund if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Service Interrupted:</strong> Technical issues on our end prevented completion of the assistance session</li>
                    <li><strong>Dissatisfaction with Service Quality:</strong> Reviewed on a case-by-case basis</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.3 Non-Refundable Situations</h3>
                <p>Refunds are generally NOT provided when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assistance was successfully provided, but your technical issue could not be resolved due to factors beyond our control (e.g., provider outage, broken equipment, line damage)</li>
                    <li>You disagree with the troubleshooting approach used, but service was rendered</li>
                    <li>Your issue requires actions only your provider can perform (e.g., service restoration after non-payment)</li>
                    <li>You chose not to follow our guidance or recommendations</li>
                    <li>The refund request is made more than 30 days after the service date</li>
                    <li>You are dissatisfied with your internet/cable provider (we are independent from all providers)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Understanding Service Limitations</h2>
                <p><strong>Smart Choice Internet provides guidance and technical assistance—not guarantees of problem resolution.</strong> Many factors affect whether your issue can be resolved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physical equipment damage requiring replacement</li>
                    <li>Service provider network outages or maintenance</li>
                    <li>Line damage requiring professional repair</li>
                    <li>Account status issues (e.g., service suspended for non-payment)</li>
                    <li>Provider-side configuration problems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our fee is for the time, expertise, and guidance we provide—not for guaranteed outcomes. If our guidance identifies an issue that requires provider intervention, we have still provided valuable diagnostic service.</p>

                <h2>4. Refund Request Process</h2>
                
                <h3>4.1 Refund Request Timeframe</h3>

For best results, contact us as soon as you have concerns about the service you received.</p>

                </ul>

                <h3>4.4 Review Timeline</h3>
                <p>We will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acknowledge your request within 2 business days</li>
                    <li>Review your request and service records</li>
                    <li>Provide a decision within 5-7 business days</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.5 Refund Processing</h3>
                <p>If your refund is approved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refunds are issued to the original payment method</li>
                    <li>Processing typically takes 7-10 business days</li>
                    <li>You will receive confirmation once the refund is processed</li>
                    <li>Bank processing time may add additional days before funds appear</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Dispute Escalation</h2>
                <p>If you disagree with our refund decision:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Contact us at disputes@connectcare-assist.com to request escalation</li>
                    <li>A senior manager will review your case</li>
                    <li>You'll receive a final decision within 10 business days</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you remain unsatisfied, you may have the option to file a chargeback with your credit card company or pursue other legal remedies as outlined in our Terms & Conditions.</p>

                <h2>6. Chargebacks</h2>
                <p>If you initiate a chargeback without first contacting us for a refund, we may be unable to provide context to your financial institution. We encourage you to work with us directly before pursuing a chargeback, as we are committed to resolving disputes fairly.</p>
                <p>Fraudulent chargebacks (where service was legitimately provided) may result in termination of future service access and potential legal action.</p>

                <h2>7. Service Fee vs. Provider Charges</h2>
                <p><strong>Critical Distinction:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smart Choice Internet Fee:</strong> Our assistance fee (refund policy applies)</li>
                    <li><strong>Provider Charges:</strong> Any costs from your internet/cable provider (does NOT fall under our refund policy)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have concerns about charges from your internet or cable provider, you must contact that provider directly. We have no ability to issue refunds for provider charges, as we are an independent company not affiliated with any provider.</p>

                <h2>8. Promotional Offers and Discounts</h2>
                <p>If you received service under a promotional offer or discount:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refunds are based on the amount actually paid, not the original price</li>
                    <li>Promotional terms may include specific refund limitations</li>
                    <li>Free or heavily discounted services may not be eligible for refunds</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. No Show / Scheduled Call Refunds</h2>
                <p>If you schedule a callback appointment and:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>We don't call:</strong> Full refund issued automatically</li>
                    <li><strong>You're unavailable:</strong> Rescheduling available; refunds at our discretion</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>10. Quality Commitment</h2>
                <p>While we cannot guarantee problem resolution, we are committed to providing professional, courteous, and competent assistance. If you feel our service quality was deficient, please let us know so we can address it and consider your refund request.</p>

                <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
