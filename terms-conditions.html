                <h2>3. Independent Third-Party Status</h2>
                <p><strong>Smart Choice Internet operates as an independent business entity.</strong> We have no affiliation, partnership, authorization, or endorsement relationship with any internet service provider, cable company, or telecommunications organization. We are not acting as a representative, agent, or affiliate of any provider.</p>
                <p>Any service plans or services you may choose to purchase based on our guidance are transactions directly between you and your chosen provider—not with Smart Choice Internet.</p>

                <h2>4. Service Fees</h2>
                
                <h3>4.1 Assistance Fee</h3>

                <h3>4.2 Fee Separate from Provider Costs</h3>
